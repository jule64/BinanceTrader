# Binance Trader

A fast and minimalist front end for trading cryptos on the Binance Exchange.

## Background

I originally built this app to trade on the FTX exchange (see my repo of the same name in my account profile). However since the exchange is now defunct I decided to port the app to Binance.

!Note:  The code is currently unusable while I am working on switching all the API calls to the Binance API.  Once I am done with
that and the tests look good I will push the working code and README updates.
